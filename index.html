    <h2>Race Report: Orcas Island 100, 2018</h2>
    <p>I run on trails a lot. Sometimes I run for 24-plus hours at a time. This blog is about the most recent race I ran.</p>
      <h3>Prologue</h3>
<p>In early 2017, my significant other (he’ll be lurking in the background of this story a bit - heretofore called Ben) moved to San Juan Island, Washington. A couple months later, I moved out there as well, and spent the spring and summer running on the trails and roads of the islands in the Harro Strait, including Orcas Island. Even though I technically live 1400 miles away, across seas and mountains, it feels like my backyard, hometown ultra. So I signed up without weighing (or honestly even realizing) factors like the 26,000 ft of elevation gain, the 14 hours of darkness, the lack of pacers, or the potential for winter weather.</p>
<p>Here's a map showing you where the Orcas Island 100 is in relation to Seattle and Denver.</p>

      <h3>Training 1</h3>
      <p>No one really wants to hear about this part. I ran a lot. For the most part, I felt really good. Then I felt a cold coming on the week before the race and consumed copious amounts of vitamin C and zinc to stave off the worst effects.</p>
      <h3>The Journey West</h3>
      <p>I flew out to Seattle Thursday morning and jumped in a van full of strangers to ride up to the ferry. (Thanks for the ride, runner Alex!) It was a gorgeous, sunny day, exactly the kind of day you don’t expect in the Pacific Northwest, so we kept nervously asking each other, “Will it last?” Spoiler: It did!</p>
      <p>The ferry out to Orcas Island was populated with ultra runner tropes: Lots of trucker hats, race T-shirts, running shoes, beards, puffy jackets, buffs, etc. Never have I ever seen so many ultra runners on a ferry.</p>
